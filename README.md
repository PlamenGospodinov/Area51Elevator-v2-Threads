# Area51Elevator-v2
University project for "Parallel programming". This is a project that simulates a workday at base "Area 51" and more specifically the work of an elevator.A thread is created for each agent.The elevator is also serviced by its own separate thread.Every time you start the program actions are random so it really looks like a simulation - everything is unpredictable.
